    <h2> About Julia</h2>
    <p> Hello, my name is Julia Arukakkal. I am a junior Computer Science major at Texas A&M, aiming for a career in technology and software development.
        Currently, I work in a genomics research lab where I apply my programming skills to analyze, build pipelines, and interpret large genomes. 
        I enjoy unravelling complex problems and investigating different viewpoints with a team. In addition, I value strong communication & leadership skills 
        through volunteering, teaching computer science, & leading women-focused organizations. I am eager to use my skills to build exciting and innovative technologies.</p>

    <h2> Technical Areas of Interest </h2>
    <h3> Big Data</h3>
    Through my experience in genomics, I have had the opportunity to work on very large datasets (8 Gb). I enjoy finding patterns in what orginally seems like noise, and being able to tell a story with it. 
    This interest was furthered through exploring different data structures and their potential to optimize many commercial avenues. In the future, I would like to investigate on methods to make these processes more efficient, such as using GPUs rather than CPUs. 

    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    I intially thought Machine Learning was solely used for search engines, but found that they can be used for a variety of uses. I have personally used it in genomic processing in a tool designed to reduce machine bias, as well as a tool to predict stroke risk. In the future, I would like to investigate the role of machine learning in constructing protein alignments and more predicitive analysises.
